# Appendix — LLM Prompts, Outputs, and My Revisions

This appendix records how I used an LLM and how I revised outputs to ensure accuracy and authenticity. “LLM Draft” blocks show initial text; “My Revision” explains the edits I made.

## A. Site Map / Information Architecture
> **LLM Draft (prompted):** “Create a multi-page MBA portfolio: Home, Resume, Projects, Skills, Contact; optional Reflection and Appendix.”

::: callout-tip
**My Revision:** Kept the five core pages and **required** Reflection & Appendix. I added a **“More”** dropdown in the navbar for Reflection and Appendix to keep the primary nav concise.
:::

## B. Home Page Intro
> **LLM Draft (original):** “Welcome to my portfolio. I’m passionate about analytics and digital transformation. Explore my work below.”

::: callout-note
**My Revision:** Replaced with specific achievements and roles: *14+ years* in banking & customer service leadership, *marketing/outreach* experience, and my **MBA** in Business Analytics & Digital Transformation. I removed generic adjectives and kept a professional voice.
:::

## C. Projects Page Sections
> **LLM Draft (original):** “Add a project on digital transformation with references; include a retail analytics project and a churn analysis dashboard.”

::: callout-important
**My Revision:** Specified **Cleveland Clinic (digital transformation)**, **Smart Shelves & RFID (ROI framing)**, and a **Customer Churn Dashboard (Tableau)**. I kept claims descriptive and will add **APA citations** only for facts I can verify.
:::

## D. Skills Page
> **LLM Draft (original):** “List soft skills and tools.”

::: callout-tip
**My Revision:** Organized into **Core Skills**, **Tools**, **Certifications**, and **Strength Highlights** (conflict resolution, data-informed decisions, outreach). Removed buzzwords and tied items to real contexts (banking, healthcare, education).
:::

## E. Styling and Theme
> **LLM Draft (original CSS idea):** “Use a dark theme with a professional font.”

::: callout-note
**My Revision:** Implemented a custom `styles.css` with **#0b1e39** background, white text, and gold headings; ensured link color contrast and added a `.profile` class for a small, rounded headshot.
:::

## F. Contact & Google Form
> **LLM Draft (original):** “Embed a contact form.”

::: callout-tip
**My Revision:** Embedded a **Google Form** via `<iframe>` and added a **direct link** as fallback for accessibility. Kept width responsive and height adjustable.
:::

## G. Citations Policy
> **LLM Draft (original):** “Add references to make it look credible.”

::: callout-important
**My Revision:** I will only include **APA-style citations** for facts or statistics I can verify. Any unverified claim was removed or rewritten.
