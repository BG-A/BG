Separating **Resume**, **Projects**, **Skills**, and **Contact** reduced scrolling, made each section scannable, and let me maintain content independently. The Quarto navbar standardized navigation across pages, while an external `styles.css` file ensured a consistent brand (dark blue background, gold headings, professional sans-serif font). Page-level front matter also helped me keep titles and anchors clean.\n\n## Ensuring authenticity and accuracy\nI treated LLM output as a *drafting* tool, not a source of truth. I replaced generic phrasing with my own achievements (e.g., **14+ years** in banking & customer service, **marketing/outreach** roles, and my **MBA** focus in Business Analytics & Digital Transformation). Where I referenced projects (e.g., Cleveland Clinic case, smart shelves/RFID ROI, churn dashboard), I kept the wording descriptive and avoided unverifiable statistics. Any external facts will include **APA-style citations**; unverified claims were removed. I also checked for biased or exaggerated language and toned it down to match a professional voice.\n\n## Usability and accessibility checks\nI chose high-contrast colors (dark #0b1e39 background, light text, gold headings) and verified legibility on desktop and a narrow browser window. Links are descriptive (e.g., “Download PDF: resume.pdf”), the profile image uses simple alt text, and the site works with keyboard navigation. I kept paths lowercase with forward slashes (e.g., `assets/profile.jpg`) to avoid case-sensitivity issues when deploying to GitHub Pages.
