    "text": "LLM use notice: I used an LLM to brainstorm structure, draft first versions of page copy, and suggest CSS ideas. I revised all generated text for accuracy, tone, and personal fit, and I verified any claims before publishing.\n\n\nMoving from a single page to a multi-page site clarified my information architecture. Separating Resume, Projects, Skills, and Contact reduced scrolling, made each section scannable, and let me maintain content independently. The Quarto navbar standardized navigation across pages, while an external styles.css file ensured a consistent brand (dark blue background, gold headings, professional sans-serif font). Page-level front matter also helped me keep titles and anchors clean.\n\n\n\nI treated LLM output as a drafting tool, not a source of truth. I replaced generic phrasing with my own achievements (e.g., 14+ years in banking & customer service, marketing/outreach roles, and my MBA focus in Business Analytics & Digital Transformation). Where I referenced projects (e.g., Cleveland Clinic case, smart shelves/RFID ROI, churn dashboard), I kept the wording descriptive and avoided unverifiable statistics. Any external facts will include APA-style citations; unverified claims were removed. I also checked for biased or exaggerated language and toned it down to match a professional voice.\n\n\n\nI chose high-contrast colors (dark #0b1e39 background, light text, gold headings) and verified legibility on desktop and a narrow browser window. Links are descriptive (e.g., “Download PDF: resume.pdf”), the profile image uses simple alt text, and the site works with keyboard navigation. I kept paths lowercase with forward slashes (e.g., assets/profile.jpg) to avoid case-sensitivity issues when deploying to GitHub Pages. I also created a fallback link for my embedded Google Form so users can open it in a new tab if the iframe is blocked.\n\n\n\n\nSmall, reversible steps prevent big errors. Editing _quarto.yml, adding pages, and adjusting CSS incrementally kept the project stable.\n\nClean builds matter. Removing stray *_files folders and rendering only to docs/ solved conflicts.\n\nLLMs accelerate, humans authenticate. Drafts are helpful, but credibility comes from my edits, experience, and proper citations.\n\n\n\n\nI will add screenshots and links for each project, include concise metrics on my Resume page, run a basic accessibility audit, and continue refining content as my coursework and professional experience evolve."
